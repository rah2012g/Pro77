    <h1>Console-The system creates a screen buffer whenever it creates a new console. To open a handle to a console's active screen buffer, specify the CONOUT$ value in a call to the CreateFile function. A process can use the CreateConsoleScreenBuffer function to create additional screen buffers for its console. A new screen buffer is not active until its handle is specified in a call to the SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer function. However, screen buffers can be accessed for reading and writing whether they are active or inactive. Each screen buffer has its own two-dimensional array of character information records. The data for each character is stored in a CHAR_INFO structure that specifies the Unicode or ANSI character and the foreground and background colors in which that character is displayed. A number of properties associated with a screen buffer can be set independently for each screen buffer. This means that changing the active screen buffer can have a dramatic effect on the appearance of the console window. The properties associated with a screen buffer include:</h1>
